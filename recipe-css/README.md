# Recipe Project CSS

The original `HTML` was created for [**Odin Project > Foundation Course > HTML Foundations**](https://github.com/OdinProjectAssignmentsByPW80/html-foundations_project-recipes).

The task details were as follows:

> Remember the Recipe page you created as practice from the HTML Foundations section? Well, it’s rather plain looking, isn’t it? Let’s fix that by adding some `CSS` to it!
> - How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external CSS method (for this practice and moving forward). You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the previous lesson (color, background color, typography properties, etc). Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don’t worry at all about making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume.
> - We haven’t covered how to use a custom font for the `font-family` property yet, so for now take a look at [CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_font.asp) for a list of generic font families to use, and [CSS Web Safe Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).

The starter `HTML` was, understandably naive - at that point the syllabus had not even covered `id` or `class` properties. Even now, without using more advanced features, beyond the scope of instruction, styling is still somewhat limited. However, the purpose is practice and experimentation not a true final product.
